    "<p>This notebook contains an analysis of a dataset containing information on medical appointments in Brazil. The focus of the analysis is on predicting whether or not patients will show up for their scheduled appointments.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> This analysis is carried out as part of the project requirements for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree programme which requires demonstrating the ability to conduct independent data analysis and to communicate observed findings.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The analysis aims to answer the following questions:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>What factors are important for predicting whether or not a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?</li>\n",
    "  <li>Are there any trends or patterns in the data that can help us understand why some patients miss their appointments?</li>\n",
    "  <li>Given the statistical relationship between receiving SMS messages and attending appointments, if a more efficient bulk text system is introduced, would this significantly improve attendance of scheduled appointments?</li>\n",
